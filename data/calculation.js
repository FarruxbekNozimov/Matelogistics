		text: "The fewer the distance, the higher cost per mile. We can divide the distance into 3 categories, 1-short 0-500 miles (~$1.63/mile), 2-medium 501-1500 miles (~$0.92/mile), 3-long 1501+ miles (~$0.62/mile).<br/><br/>Letâ€™s show some example, 300 miles distance could cost around $489, 800 miles distance could cost around $736, or 1800 miles distance could cost around $1,116.<br/><br/>Car shipping costs vary based on several factors such as distance, vehicle size, transport type, vehicle condition, season, demand and additional services.",

		title: "Vehicle size and weight",
		text: "Vehicle size and weight are pivotal considerations in car shipping, significantly influencing transportation logistics and associated costs. The size refers to the dimensions of the vehicle, including its length, width, and height, while weight denotes its mass.<br/><br/>Larger vehicles or those with non-standard dimensions might require specialized transport arrangements, potentially impacting the choice between open or enclosed carriers. Oversized vehicles, such as trucks or SUVs, may necessitate specific handling accommodations during shipping.<br/><br/>Moreover, weight directly affects the cost calculations, as heavier vehicles consume more fuel and may require specialized equipment for loading and transport. Carriers have weight limits, influencing the number of vehicles they can transport simultaneously.",

		title: "Vehicle condition",
		text: "A vehicle's condition profoundly impacts its shipping process, encompassing its mechanical state, operational functionality, and overall appearance. When considering car shipping, the condition of the vehicle holds significance in determining the suitable transport method, potential risks during transit, and the overall shipping cost.<br/><br/>Operational vehicles in good condition are typically easier to transport, posing fewer logistical challenges and reducing the likelihood of additional handling requirements. Non-operational or inoperable vehicles may require special equipment or handling, affecting the choice of carrier and potentially incurring extra costs.",

	{
		title: "Transport type",
		text: "The transport type in car shipping refers to the method used to move vehicles from one location to another, each with distinct characteristics impacting cost, safety, and the level of protection provided.<br/><br/>Open transport involves vehicles being loaded onto an open carrier, exposing them to elements like weather, debris, and road conditions. While cost-effective and efficient for short to mid-range distances, it may leave vehicles susceptible to environmental factors.<br/><br/>Enclosed transport utilizes covered trailers, offering increased protection from weather, dust, and potential damage. This method is preferred for high-value, classic, or luxury vehicles, ensuring enhanced security and shielding against external elements.",

	{
		title: "Season and demand",
		text: "Seasonal fluctuations and demand impact car shipping by influencing pricing, availability, and transit times. High demand periods, typically during peak moving seasons like summer, can result in increased prices due to limited carrier availability and heightened requests for transport services.<br/><br/>Conversely, lower demand seasons might offer more competitive pricing and flexible scheduling options as carriers seek to fill their capacity. Weather conditions also affect shipping, with harsh weather in certain seasons potentially causing delays or route adjustments to ensure safe transport.",

		title: "Timeframe and urgency",
		text: "The timeframe and urgency in car shipping refer to the specific duration within which a vehicle needs to be transported, impacting the choice of service and associated costs. Urgency often dictates the need for expedited shipping services, which ensure faster delivery but typically come at a higher price.<br/><br/>Customers with flexible timelines can opt for standard shipping services, which offer more cost-effective options but might have longer transit times due to consolidating shipments or accommodating various routes.",
