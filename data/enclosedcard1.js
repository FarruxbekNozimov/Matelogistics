		title: "Cost considerations for Enclosed Auto Transport",
		text: "The cost of enclosed auto transport can vary depending on several factors. These factors include the distance of the shipment, the type of vehicle being transported, the level of insurance coverage required, and any additional services requested. The pricing for enclosed auto transport services follows the same approach as open car transport, but you should anticipate paying roughly 20-40% more for the added protection. For standard-sized vehicles, the average cost for short routes (1-400 miles) is approximately $598, medium routes (400-1400 miles) average $848, and longer routes (1500+ miles) average $1078.",
